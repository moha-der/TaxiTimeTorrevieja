If the User is under 14 years of age, the consent of their parents or guardians will be required for the processing, and it will only be considered lawful to the extent that they have authorized it.</p>
                <h4>Secrecy and security of personal data:</h4>
                <p>TaxiTimeTorrevieja undertakes to adopt the necessary technical and organizational measures, according to the level of security appropriate to the risk of the data collected, in such a way as to guarantee the security of personal data and prevent its destruction, loss, or alteration accidental or unlawful of personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed, or unauthorized communication or access to such data.</p>
                <p>The Website has an SSL certificate (Secure Socket Layer), which ensures that personal data is transmitted securely and confidentially, as the transmission of data between the server and the User, and in feedback, is fully encrypted or encrypted.</p>
                <p>However, since TaxiTimeTorrevieja cannot guarantee the impregnability of the internet or the total absence of hackers or others who access personal data fraudulently, the Data Controller undertakes to notify the User without undue delay when a violation of the security of personal data occurs that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals.

                <p>-Right of access: It is the User's right to obtain confirmation of whether TaxiTimeTorrevieja is processing their personal data or not and, if so, obtain information about their specific personal data and the processing that TaxiTimeTorrevieja has carried out or is carrying out, as well as, among other things, the information available on the origin of such data and the recipients of the communications made or planned for them.</p>
                <p>-Right to rectification: It is the User's right to have their personal data modified if it is inaccurate or, taking into account the purposes of the processing, incomplete.</p>
                <p>-Right to erasure ("the right to be forgotten"): It is the User's right, as long as current legislation does not establish otherwise, to obtain the erasure of their personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or processed; the User has withdrawn their consent to the processing and this processing does not have another legal basis; the User opposes the processing and there is no other legitimate reason to continue with it; the personal data has been processed unlawfully; the personal data must be erased in compliance with a legal obligation; or the personal data has been obtained as a result of a direct offer of information society services to a child under 14 years of age. In addition to deleting the data, the Data Controller, taking into account the available technology and the cost of its application, must take reasonable measures to inform the data controllers who are processing the personal data of the interested party's request for deletion of any link to that personal data.</p>
                <p>-Right to restriction of processing: It is the User's right to restrict the processing of their personal data. The User has the right to obtain the limitation of the processing when they challenge the accuracy of their personal data; the processing is unlawful; the Data Controller no longer needs the personal data, but the User needs it to make claims; and when the User has objected to the processing.</p>
                <p>-Right to data portability: In the event that the processing is carried out by automated means, the User will have the right to receive from the Data Controller their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit it to another data controller. Whenever technically possible, the Data Controller will transfer the data directly to that other controller.</p>
                <p>Right to object: It is the User's right to prevent the processing of their personal data or to cease the processing thereof by TaxiTimeTorrevieja.</p>
                <p>Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling: It is the User's right not to be subject to an individualized decision based solely on automated processing of their personal data, including profiling, unless current legislation establishes otherwise.</p>
                <p>Therefore, the User may exercise their rights by means of a written communication addressed to the Data Controller with the reference "GDPR-https://www.taxitimetorreviejatoairport.com/", specifying:</p>
                <p>-Name and surname of the User and a copy of their ID. In cases where representation is admitted, the identification of the person representing the User will also be necessary, as well as the document accrediting the representation. A photocopy of the ID may be replaced by any other valid legal means that prove identity.</p>
                <p>-Petition with the specific reasons for the request or information to which access is sought.</p>
                <p>This request and any other attached document can be sent to the following address and/or email:</p>
